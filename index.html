    <h1>Basket Weaving</h1>
    <p>Basket Weaving is the art of taking materials such as wooden planks or wicker and weaving them into the shape of a basket<br/>
    which can then be used to contain objects or as a decorative item. Baskets are a welcome addition to any interior decoration<br/>
  scheme and can be very useful. As you will see on this website, basket weaving can be fun too!</p>
