    <h2>Basket Weaving Techniques</h2>
    <p>Basket weaving techniques vary both in style and in skill level required to succeed. A refined basket weaver leaves no excess<br/>
      wicker or wood sticking out of the basket that can catch, scrape or otherwise harm the basket's content or its user. On this page, we will <br/>
      explore 3 different ways to weave baskets.</p>

    <p>Below is a list of the weaving styles we will be covering.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Randing (easy)</li>
      <li>Pairing (medium)</li>
      <li>Waling (hard)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Randing</h2>
    <img src="images/randing.jpg" height="260" width="320" alt="image of basket randing style weaving"/>
    <p> Randing is often considered the most simple type of basket weaving to do. As shown in the above image, it involves weaving<br/>
      the wicker under one stake and then over the next, etc. The randing technique should be done with an odd number of stakes, lest<br/>
      the weave become uneven.</p>

    <h2>Pairing</h2>
    <img src="images/pairing.jpg" height="300" width="320" alt="image of basket pairing style weaving"/>
    <p> Pairing is where basket weaving becomes slightly more advanced. A more decorative approach than randing, pairing utilizes<br/>
      2 weavers that twist around each other and are woven over the stakes. This is often used for rims of baskets where decoration is<br/>
      a symbol of quality.</p>

    <h2>Waling</h2>
    <img src="images/waling.jpg" height="281" width="369" alt="image of basket waling style weaving"/>
    <p> Waling is considered the most complicated, but strongest, method of basket weaving. As shown in the image above, it involves<br/>
      weaving the wicker around the stakes in multiple different patterns, creating a potentially beautiful basket with exceptional strength.</p>
